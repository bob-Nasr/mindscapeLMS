# mindscapeLMS (2024)

- To work with Moodle, you need to have Wampserver64 and Visual Studio downloaded.

- You can download Wampserver from https://wampserver.aviatechno.net/
To work with it, you would need an internet browser. Go to the taskbar and click on the icon.
Choose PhpMyAdmin, then enter as username "root" and nothing for passsword.

- After fixing Wampserver, you clone this repo to C:\wamp64\www\m433\ (or where you installed Wampserver).
To acceess a file, replace the location with http://localhost/m433 followed by the rest of the location (C:\wamp64\www\ is replaced by localhost)
To start it up, enter http://localhost/m433/moodle/install.php
During the installation process here, Moodle will fix the database and tables before taking you to the main dashboard
